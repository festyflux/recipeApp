# recipe_app

This is the initial UI of my recipe App. 
In the coming days, I will add more functionality including:
1. Enabling signup and login with Firebase, so user will have to login to access the recipe app
2. Development of other pages (Recipes, Subscription, Account), whose Icons are on the bottom navigation
3. Setting up search function and notification
4. Final touches
